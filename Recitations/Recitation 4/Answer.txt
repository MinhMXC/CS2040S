No, because in a B-tree, all leaf must be of the
same depth while that is not the case in BST

1.1
a. Yes, Rule 3
b. Min: 1, Max: logn
c. Dictionary

cur = root
while (cur != target) 
  interval = find_interval(target)
  cur = dic(interval)

1.2
In the case of min children and min key,
adding one more children will require one more key

do the same split with the parent key

e. Bruh too lazy

1.3
1.f
contains b - 1 keys && a <= (b + 1) / 2 => a <= 2b => z contains >= 2a keys
if z's parents contains b - 1 keys, it would have been split => parents contains <= b - 2 keys

w would have been splitted if it contains b - 1 keys

all full node is splitted and x is inserted into a leaf to height depth doesnt increase

1.g. O(loga(n))

1.h. O(logb(n))

2.
a. O(n/B)
b. O(log(n/B))
c. O(B), O(B), O(B)
d. O(h), O(h), O(h)
