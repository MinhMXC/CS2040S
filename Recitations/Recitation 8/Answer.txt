1.
a.
Each node store info of the possible edges to go to for each
direction North, South, East, West that the car is showing

Going Straight => weight = 0
Going Right => weight = 1

Dijkstra's algorithm


2.
a. BFS since graph in unweighted
b. Modify graph such that for each node, we create two nodes,
one node for even day, one node for odd day. Even node contains even
edges, odd node contains odd edges

BFS since graph is also unweighted

c.
Easy solution: run BFS two time for odd and even start

One BFS Time: 
Create a dummy node that connects to even and odd start
And start there instead

d.
Manon can stay overnight:
Simply connect even and odd edge
