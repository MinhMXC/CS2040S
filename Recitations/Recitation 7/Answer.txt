1.
a. Double for loop trivial solution
Time: O(n^2)
Space: O(1)

b. Sort the price array with quicksort then visit 
each element that is less than or equal to n/2 
and binary search for the corresponding
Time: O(nlogn)
Space: O(logn)

Modify the array so that it includes pairs of item number
and its price.

c. HashSet standard solution.
Duplicates: Use a HashMap instead

Time: O(n)
Space: O(n)

d. Remove the prices from the array / hashmap after a pair
has been found and continue with the algorithm

e. Calculate the sums of all the pairs and put them in
a hashset and iterate over the array and check if the
corresponding sum exist
Time: O(n^2)
Space: O(n^2)


2.
a.
O(n)
O(n)
Infinite since the process does not terminate

b. O(n^2)
