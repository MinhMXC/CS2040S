1. Sort the edges
2. Iterate through the edges from smallest to largest
3. If the two node is already in the same union then continue
4. Else union the two nodes of the edges
5. The minimax distance from all the nodes in the larger union to
the smaller union and vice versa is the weight of the edge

Time: O(ElogE)
Space: O(V^2)
