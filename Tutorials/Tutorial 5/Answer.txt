1.
AVL:
- Larger memory usage
- Harder to implement
- Operations are now O(nlogn) since comparing two strings is O(n)

Trie:
- Lower memory usage
- Easier to implement
- Operations are O(logn)

2.
a.
Compare the point's x and y values with the nodes to
see which part of the tree the point is

b.
Find the median x value [0 ... n-1]
Insert median x node into the tree
Recurse but find median y value 
Alternate between y and x values between each recursive call
At the end, insert every points into the leaves

Runtime: O(nlogn)

c.
n / 2 + n / 8 + n / 32 + ... = O(n)

3.
Trie with each node having two variables to store the
numbers of female and male babies having that name
